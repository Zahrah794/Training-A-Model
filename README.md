# Training-A-Model

## Description

In this project, Teachable Machine, a user-friendly machine learning platform, is utilized to train a model to classify images into two distinct classes. The first class comprises retriever dog images, while the second class encompasses black cat images. The training process involves providing a labeled dataset of these two classes to Teachable Machine, which then leverages its underlying machine learning algorithms to learn and create a model capable of distinguishing between the two classes. 
Once the training is complete, a test image can be inputted into the trained model to evaluate its performance. The model will analyze the provided image and predict whether it belongs to the retriever dog class or the black cat class. This test serves as an assessment of the model's ability to generalize and accurately classify unseen images based on the patterns and features it has learned during the training phase.
